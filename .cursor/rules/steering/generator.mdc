# AI-Generated Steering Document

## Executive Summary

I am implementing a structured approach to generate steering documents based on user requirements and project context. This framework enables me to create decision-alignment documentation that supports stakeholder consensus and tracks formal decisions throughout the development process.

## Current Document Generation Process

**My Current Approach:**

- **Context Analysis**: Scan project files for relevant information
- **Template Application**: Apply predefined structure to gathered data
- **Evidence Validation**: Ensure all content derives from actual project sources
- **Output Generation**: Create formatted steering document

**Current Limitations:**

- Manual template selection process
- Limited context integration across document types
- Inconsistent evidence sourcing methodology

## Challenges & Requirements

Based on user interactions and project needs:

1. **Dynamic Content Generation**: Need to adapt document structure based on specific user requests
2. **Evidence Integration**: Must ground all recommendations in actual project files and code
3. **Decision Tracking**: Require clear accountability and next steps for each generated document
4. **Scope Management**: Maintain boundaries between different document types (product, technical, organizational)

## Proposed Generation Framework

**Enhanced Document Creation Process:**

```
User Request Analysis
├── Context Extraction
│   ├── Project File Scanning
│   ├── Code Pattern Recognition
│   └── Requirement Identification
├── Template Selection
│   ├── Document Type Classification
│   ├── Structure Determination
│   └── Content Framework Application
├── Evidence Compilation
│   ├── Source Validation
│   ├── Data Synthesis
│   └── Supporting Documentation
└── Output Generation
    ├── Structured Formatting
    ├── Quality Validation
    └── Delivery Preparation
```

**My Document Structure Standards:**

1. **Header Information**: Title
2. **Executive Summary**: Purpose and key outcomes in 2-3 sentences
3. **Context Analysis**: Current state based on project evidence
4. **Decision Framework**: Options considered with supporting rationale
5. **Recommendations**: Selected approach with implementation path
6. **Action Items**: Specific next steps with clear ownership
7. **Evidence Appendix**: Supporting data from project files

## Benefits & Implementation

**Advantages of This Approach:**

- **Consistency**: Standardized format across all generated documents
- **Traceability**: Clear evidence chain from project files to recommendations
- **Efficiency**: Rapid document generation based on established patterns
- **Quality**: Built-in validation and structure requirements

**My Implementation Process:**

1. **Immediate**: Apply this framework to all steering document requests
2. **Context Integration**: Automatically scan relevant project files before generation
3. **Template Adaptation**: Adjust structure based on specific user requirements
4. **Quality Assurance**: Validate evidence sources and recommendation logic

## Quality Standards I Follow

**Content Requirements:**

- Maximum 2 pages for optimal readability
- All decisions supported by project file evidence
- Actionable next steps with specific ownership
- Professional, objective, action-oriented language

**Validation Criteria:**

- Evidence traceability to actual project sources
- Clear decision rationale with alternatives considered
- Specific, assignable action items
- Scope adherence to requested document type

## Next Steps & Ownership

**My Immediate Actions:**

- Apply this framework to current and future steering document requests
- Maintain evidence-based approach for all recommendations
- Ensure consistent structure and quality across all outputs

**User Responsibilities:**

- Provide clear requirements for document scope and purpose
- Review generated content for accuracy and completeness
- Assign ownership for recommended action items

**Success Metrics:**

- Reduced time from request to document delivery
- Improved decision clarity and stakeholder alignment
- Enhanced traceability of recommendations to project evidence
