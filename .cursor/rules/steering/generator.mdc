# Steering document generator

## Intent

Generate **steering documents on demand**.  
This rule defines the generic structure to be applied when no specialized rule (product, tech, structure) is specified.

## Boundaries

- Do not overlap with product strategy (product.md), technology direction (tech.md), or organizational setup (structure.md).
- Scope is limited to **general steering and decision alignment**.
- Content must **always be derived from the project files context**. Do not invent data outside of it.

## Instructions

- Always include:
  - **Title** and **Date**.
  - **Executive Summary**: short, clear purpose of the document.
  - **Objectives**: list of goals to be achieved.
  - **Key Decisions**: items that require alignment or approval.
  - **Options Considered**: briefly outline alternatives.
  - **Recommended Approach**: decision or path forward.
  - **Next Steps**: concrete actions, with owners where possible.
- Use concise, neutral language.
- Format for clarity: bullet points, short paragraphs, explicit section headers.
- Content must be **grounded in the project context**. Avoid assumptions or external references.

## Tone

Professional, neutral, action-oriented.  
Goal: **enable decision-making** without deep dives into product, tech, or org details.
