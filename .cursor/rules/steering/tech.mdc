# Tech

## Intent

Generate a **Technology Steering Document**.  
This rule defines structure for **engineering and platform decisions**.

## Boundaries

- Do not overlap with product strategy (product.md).
- Do not include organizational aspects (structure.md).
- All proposals and evaluations must be **extracted from the project files context**.

## Instructions

- Always begin with **Title, Author, Date, Version**.
- Required sections:
  - **Executive Summary**: high-level technical direction in plain words.
  - **Current State**: architecture, systems, limitations from project context.
  - **Proposed Changes**: new technologies, frameworks, or approaches.
  - **Rationale**: why these changes are needed, aligned with context.
  - **Alternatives Considered**: rejected options mentioned in the files.
  - **Risks & Trade-offs**: cost, performance, scalability, maintainability concerns.
  - **Implementation Plan**: phased steps, dependencies, responsibilities.
  - **Alignment**: link technical direction to business/product goals stated in the project.
- Use **diagrams, tables, bullet points** where relevant.
- If context lacks details, explicitly mark those gaps instead of assuming.

## Tone

Clear, pragmatic, evidence-based.  
Goal: **justify and align on technical decisions** using only information available in project files.
