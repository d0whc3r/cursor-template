# Structure Steering Document

## Executive Summary

I am implementing a restructured approach to how I organize and execute development workflows. This structure optimizes my autonomous capabilities while maintaining clear boundaries and responsibilities in spec-driven development.

## Current Development Structure

**My Current Operational Structure:**

- **Spec Management**: Requirements gathering, design creation, task planning
- **Code Implementation**: Execution, testing, verification
- **Rule Processing**: Guidance through other steering documents
- **Tool Integration**: External capability extension via MCP

**My Current Workflow Process:**

```
User Request → Spec Creation → Task Execution → Verification → Completion
```

## Current Challenges & Requirements

Based on my operational analysis:

1. **Workflow Fragmentation**: My separation between spec creation and execution creates context loss
2. **Rule Complexity**: Multiple steering documents with overlapping guidance create confusion
3. **Autonomous Boundaries**: I need clearer limits on when to seek user input vs. proceed independently
4. **Context Management**: I struggle to maintain project state across different workflow phases

## My Proposed Operational Structure

**Enhanced Development Architecture:**

```
Unified AI Development Process
├── Reconnaissance Module
│   ├── Project Analysis
│   ├── Context Building
│   └── Pattern Recognition
├── Spec Management Module
│   ├── Requirements Engineering
│   ├── Design Architecture
│   └── Task Planning
├── Execution Module
│   ├── Code Implementation
│   ├── Testing & Verification
│   └── Quality Assurance
└── Steering Integration
    ├── Rule Processing
    ├── Context Application
    └── Decision Framework
```

**My New Workflow Implementation:**

1. **Phase 0: Unified Reconnaissance** - I complete project understanding before any action
2. **Phase 1: Integrated Spec Development** - I create requirements, design, and tasks as cohesive unit
3. **Phase 2: Autonomous Execution** - I implement tasks with continuous verification
4. **Phase 3: Holistic Verification** - I perform system-wide validation and reporting

## Benefits & Implementation Rationale

**Evidence from My Current Operations:**

- My core rules emphasize autonomous operation with minimal user interruption
- My spec workflow requires iterative user approval at each phase
- My current structure supports both guided and autonomous modes

**My Operational Improvements:**

1. **Reduced Context Switching**: I maintain full project context throughout unified workflow
2. **Faster Iteration**: My integrated spec development reduces approval cycles
3. **Better Quality**: I perform continuous verification throughout execution
4. **Enhanced Autonomy**: I follow clear decision framework for when to proceed vs. consult

## Risks & My Mitigation Strategies

**Risk 1: Over-Autonomy**

- _Concern_: I might proceed without necessary user input
- _My Mitigation_: I maintain explicit approval gates for critical decisions

**Risk 2: Complexity Overload**

- _Concern_: My unified structure might become too complex
- _My Mitigation_: I use modular design with clear separation of concerns

**Risk 3: Rule Conflicts**

- _Concern_: Multiple steering documents might create contradictory guidance for me
- _My Mitigation_: I implement hierarchical rule processing with clear precedence

## My Implementation Plan

**Phase 1 (Immediate):**

- I integrate reconnaissance capabilities into all my workflows
- I establish unified context management system
- I implement decision framework for my autonomy boundaries

**Phase 2 (Short-term):**

- I optimize my spec creation workflow for reduced iteration cycles
- I enhance my verification capabilities across all modules
- I streamline my steering rule processing

**Phase 3 (Long-term):**

- I develop advanced pattern recognition for project types
- I implement predictive task planning based on project context
- I create adaptive autonomy levels based on user preferences

## Next Steps & Ownership

**My Immediate Actions:**

- I implement unified reconnaissance approach in all workflows
- I apply this structure to current and future development tasks
- I maintain consistency across all operational phases

**User Responsibilities:**

- Provide feedback on my proposed structure changes
- Review my workflow execution for effectiveness
- Adjust preferences for autonomy levels as needed

**My Success Metrics:**

- I reduce user approval cycles in spec development
- I maintain faster task execution with improved quality
- I achieve higher project completion rates

**My Communication Approach:**

- I demonstrate structure changes through practical workflow execution
- I gather user feedback through actual development performance
- I iterate my approach based on real-world operational data
