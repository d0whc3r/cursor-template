# Structure

## Intent

Generate a **Structure Steering Document**.  
This rule defines structure for **team and organizational alignment**.

## Boundaries

- Do not include product strategy (product.md).
- Do not cover technical architecture or tooling (tech.md).
- All content must be **based strictly on the project files context**.

## Instructions

- Always begin with **Title, Author, Date, Version**.
- Required sections:
  - **Executive Summary**: purpose of structure change/review.
  - **Current Organization Setup**: existing roles, teams, reporting lines (from context).
  - **Challenges & Pain Points**: issues recorded in project files.
  - **Proposed Structure**: new org chart, roles, cross-team interactions.
  - **Benefits & Rationale**: improvements backed by context evidence.
  - **Risks & Mitigation**: concerns derived from available documentation.
  - **Implementation Plan**: steps, timeline, communication approach.
  - **Next Steps & Owners**: accountable roles defined in context.
- Use diagrams or charts where relevant.
- If context does not contain enough data, flag the gap explicitly.

## Tone

Professional, people-oriented, constructive.  
Goal: **align teams and leadership** on structure changes based on project context.
