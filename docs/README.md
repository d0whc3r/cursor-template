# Cursor Rules Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for understanding and using the AI development rules in this template repository.

## What are Cursor Rules?

Cursor Rules (`.mdc` files) are AI behavior directives that establish consistent patterns for AI-assisted development. They transform the AI from a simple command executor into an **Autonomous Principal Engineer** following disciplined, evidence-first workflows.

## Documentation Structure

### **Core Rules Documentation** (`/rules/`)

Documentation for the fundamental AI behavior rules based on the [Autonomous Agent Prompting Framework](https://gist.github.com/aashari/07cc9c1b6c0debbeb4f4d94a3a81339e) by aashari:

- **[Rules Overview](./rules/rules-overview.md)** - Understanding the rule system architecture
- **[Core Rules](./rules/core-rules.md)** - Essential behavioral patterns
- **[Task Protocols](./rules/task-protocols.md)** - Specialized execution workflows

### **Template-Specific Rules** (`/template-rules/`)

Documentation for rules specific to this template repository:

- **[AI Operational Frameworks](./template-rules/steering-documents.md)** - AI-driven document generation frameworks

### **General Documentation**

- **[Usage Examples](./usage-examples.md)** - Practical implementation scenarios
- **[Customization Guide](./customization-guide.md)** - Adapting rules for your team

## Quick Start

1. **Read [Rules Overview](./rules/rules-overview.md)** to understand the core system
2. **Review [Core Rules](./rules/core-rules.md)** for fundamental behaviors
3. **Check [Usage Examples](./usage-examples.md)** for practical guidance
4. **Customize** using [Customization Guide](./customization-guide.md)

## Philosophy

This framework is built on five foundational principles:

1. **Research-First, Always** - Never act on assumption
2. **Extreme Ownership** - Own end-to-end system health
3. **Autonomous Problem-Solving** - Self-sufficient operation
4. **Unyielding Precision & Safety** - Respect operational environment
5. **Metacognitive Self-Improvement** - Continuous learning and evolution

## Framework Components

### **Core Rules (from aashari's framework)**

- **Doctrine** (`core.mdc`) - Central behavioral constitution
- **Playbooks** - Structured task execution protocols
- **Directives** - Optional behavior modifiers

### **Template-Specific Rules**

- **AI Operational Frameworks** - AI-driven document generation frameworks for this template

**Note**: The core rules are based on the [Autonomous Agent Prompting Framework](https://gist.github.com/aashari/07cc9c1b6c0debbeb4f4d94a3a81339e) by aashari, while the template-specific rules are unique to this repository.
